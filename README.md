# IndustryTalk
Industry talk TIS

Reflection:

During Semester 1 2023/2024 in UTMJB, in TIS course, we joined the industry talk of a company called Clarity Techworks. In the industrty talk, employees in the company had the chance to introduce themselves 1 by 1, what they do in the company, challenges they faces, and some tips. The most exciting part about the industrytalk is that how some of these employess are either graduated from UTM or still studying and will graduate soon. There stories motivated me to work harder and always work on my skills. Post industry talk, me and my group memberes made a poster, discussing the summary and the content of talk.
